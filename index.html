            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
St. Paul’s has a rich and vivid history of 160+ Years. It has seen thousands of Boys turn into Men, with the tireless efforts of the Management and Teachers, who have put in many hours, to mold these young minds into “Men for Others.” We, the members of the Jesuit institutions of the Goa Province, in fidelity to our Vocation as educators, are sent to build human communities based on the values of God’s Kingdom – Justice, Love and Peace – forming men and women, conscious of their mission to serve especially the underprivileged.</p>

        <section id="Motto" class="section">
            <h2>MOTTO - Our Education Policy</h2>
            <p>We teach a religious humanism in which man puts God and not himself at the centre of the universe. We therefore require every child to attend religious or value education classes as taught in the school. These religious and moral values we consider essential and of the utmost importance in our education. Our aim is not simply to teach, to develop good professional men or to give our students a chance to obtain a position in society. We must educate in such a way as to transform ourselves and change and transform society. Even if we want men to be eminent in their professions or in any form of human achievement, it is not for selfish reasons or merely for their own satisfaction; but rather to be of service to others, to be men for others. Our aim is to educate our students as persons and teach them how to live in a Community. Our plans, programmes, methods, examinations are all developed in accordance with these objectives. We hold these values; man should be a subject and not an object to be used; he must think for himself; he must have a healthy critical spirit; intellectual and affective maturity; creativity, with a strong and well-defined personality; he must be capable of upright, free and just decisions.</p>
